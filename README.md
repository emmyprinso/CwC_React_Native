# Coding with Curry - React Native
Welcome to the React Native repo for Coding with Curry. Topics Covered are added to their own branches and will be updated periodically as needed.

## Topics / Branches
* [AsyncStorage](https://github.com/JulianCurrie/CwC_React_Native/tree/async_storage)
* [Hooks & Context](https://github.com/JulianCurrie/CwC_React_Native/tree/context_api_demo)
* [Firebase](https://github.com/JulianCurrie/CwC_React_Native/tree/firebase_basics)

* [Redux](https://github.com/JulianCurrie/CwC_React_Native/tree/redux_tutorial)

## Prerequisites
Knowledge of fundamental programming concepts is required. These include things like conditional statements, loops, lists manipulation, etc. I won't be covering general programming concepts so some programming experience is expected.

## Installing (Using a terminal)
1. Copy the repo to your local machine with 'git clone https://github.com/JulianCurrie/CwC_React_Native.git'
2. cd into the top level folder
3. Make sure you have the Metro bundler running with 'react-native start'
4. **iOS**: On a mac, run the app in a simulator with 'react-native run-ios --simulator="YOUR DEVICE NAME". You may have to set up a new device in Xcode.
5. **Android**: Make sure your Android Home path is setup correctly and run the app in the emulator with 'react native run-android'

You may get errors switching between brances. Make sure you try these options first:
* Reinstall cocoa pods in the /ios folder with 'pod install'
* Resintall packages in the top level folder with 'npm install'
* You may have to delete the Podfile.lock and/or the package-lock.json file before running the commands above.

## Contributions
You may fork this repo if you wish, but I am not accepting external contributions at this time.
